# Thingy:91

Here you will find information how to compile, program and some other useful things about nRF Thingy:91.

I started this Repo as Nordic Semiconductors has made really fragmented documentation. If you just start, it's very hard to find proper way to achieve some results. Hope this will be useful also for you.

Lets get started!

## About Thingy:91

[Thingy:91](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/Nordic-Thingy-91/Download) if IoT device based on nRF9160 SIP LTE modem and nRF52840 SoC for Bluetooth communication.

User application is run by nRF9160. To make your custom app you need to download nRF SDK. In future commits I will made detailed step-by-step guide on how to get started with nRF SDK.

## Serial Ports of Thingy:91
